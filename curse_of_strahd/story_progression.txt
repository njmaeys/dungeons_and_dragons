###############################################
Tarot card reading is the kind of entry into this whole story. I want to have them be greated by the story teller in the woods. The Inn keeper (Granti - Female elf). There is rumor of a camp of bandits on the outskirts of town that keep harassing the town. A few groups have tried to get them to go away but have been unsucessful. 

They can come across the group in the woods outside of town. A small fire is burning with a couple individuals around it. The fog thickens and can only see the orange light dancing in the fog. Stanmir will roll perception if necessary and greet them. His goal is to tell them the story.

--------------------------------------
# Session 2 (2022-01-26)

After the card reading she closes the door. She tells the players she wishes to remove the hold that Strahd has over the land. She herself cannot be the one to accomplish this task. They may be abale to find aid in Barovia. She will be willing to answer questions they have.

I should direct them towards the village of Barovia. This is where Donavich is who is their ally against Strahd. 
From the Madam Eva (Visanti village) it'll take about 2 hours (6ish miles). 

The gallows along their travel. They find a gallows which is begging to rot. There are unmarked graves around this structure and sign posts. 

Upon entering Barovia the streets seem baron. It is dreaery and delapedated. Have them make perception checks. They can hear light whailing which is coming from Doru, Donavich's son. The do not see the building it is coming from. There is only one building with lights on that they can see at the moment. All of the doors have scratch marks on them.

I want them to either go directly towards the church or, or go to where Ismark the Lesser is, or go to the lit building where Ireena Kolyana is.
	- If they go towards Ireena then have Strahd show up at the door at some point.
		- He doesn't want to fight just to see Ireena and is pleased to see fresh faces in Barovia.
		- Ireena wants to get the buroughmaster (Kolyan Indirovich) to the cemetary for a proper burial
	- If they go to the tavern in the center of town there is a sign which reads Blood on the Vine Tavern
		- Ismark asks the party to help him get his sister (Ireena) to the Vallaki (west of here)
			- has heard assertions it is safe and that Strahd would have difficulties getting to her there
	- If they go to the Church
		- The whailing gets more pronounced and eventually they can make out some of the words
		- Donavich refuses to help until his "son" has been taken care of

--------------------------------------
# Session 3 (2022-02-09)

What does Donavich (their ally and Strahd's enemy) have to offer?
	- knowledge of barovia (see sticky note on barovian lore)
	- knows of the Sunsword and the lore behind it
		- said to have once been the blad of Strahd's brother, Sergie von Zarovich
		- i've never seen it myself but heard it has unatural powers
	- he warns that Castle Ravenloft is a very dangerous place
		- the procession of souls is proof enough for me
		- no one is welcome in Castle Ravenloft without Sthrad's invitation
			- making it within the walls unoticed is likely nearly impossible
	- offers two potions of healing (2d4+2)
		- all i can offer at the moment but if you can find supplies or give me some time i can make more
		- i'm well practiced in potion making, if there is anything you can think of for use let me know
			- he can try and make it but will take time

*** IMPORTANT ***
Be sure during conversation to say something about
	- Thanking them for saving him. I felt as though my mind was shattered, breaking into thousands of pieces
		- they put him back together 

When they leave him
	- If and when you are ready to take on that monster, the bastard Sthrad find me, I will be by your side
		- He took my boy from me and i wish to take his life from him
*** IMPORTANT ***

My initial goal here is to get them to talk with Ireena Kolyana (the Tatyana look alike)
	- I want her to be their guide to Vallaki
	- She shows up after saying the wolf attacks had stopped and she hasn't heard the screaming from the church
		- She needs help getting her father (Kolyan Indirovich) to the grave
		- She can carry him but cannot carry his coffin
			- He was growing old and he wanted to hand craft his own knowing that his days were numbered
			- didn't expect it so soon, she suspects the constant barage of wolf attacks drove his demise

Strahd "attack" at Ireena's house
	- He doesn't attack unless provoked
	- Says he is so "sorry" to see that Kolyan has died
		- really he could care less and is the one who sent the barage of wolf attacks/

--------------------------------------
# Session 4 (2022-02-16)

Need to open right after the fight and point out the note in the scarecrow body
	- They notice a small red glimmer on the scarecrow. Small folded piece of paper sealed with a small drop of wax

	- When they enter
		- There is a large iron gate and dense fog rolling at the foot of the walls
			- Shadowy figures appear on either side of the road unmoving as you approach 
			- 6 pikes with wolf heads on the side of the road

			- Upcomming event Festival of the Blazing Sun
			- He imprisons anyone not playing by his rules
		- Provide them information of the library in the city

	- All members of the Keepers of the Feather and a secret society of wereravens

Urwin tests them to see if they are worthy
	- Wine supply is almost empty and next shipment is overdue
	- The supplier is the Wizard of Wines, local winery and vineyard

--------------------------------------
# Session 6 (2022-04-11)

Reason why Urwin and Davian have hard time together
	- Urwin blames Davian for his mom's death
		- Mom's name: Milna
	- She was killed during the attack that took the 2nd seed (Hag)
		- Urwin thinks Davian could have done more
		- Davian was staying back to protect the kids
			- Urwin says he was old enough to protect the rest and Davian should have helped her

Urwin wants to give them the sword
	- Buys the extra wine from them if they offer
	- The fancy wine would be a decent offer to Baron Vargas Vallakovich
	- Why does he want to give them the sword?
		- He has been working to re-build their force and believes the group can be of use
		- Taking out the group of druids would be great
	- Addtionally if they so choose to work with the Keepers of the Feather
		- Gives them a key to a small duplex a few blocks away
		- Gives them a small bronze feather
			- Used as a distress beacon and a small number of members will come to their Aid
				- Enchantment takes a day to recharge

--------------------------------------
# Session 7 (2022-05-09)

#### RECAP LAST SESSION ####
	- searched the winery and found very little wine supply left
		- with one seed Davion has been able to maintain but with last seed gone has not chance
	- returned the wine to Blue Water Inn for Urwin
	- Urwin reveals him and Danika are top members of Keepers of the Feather 
		- asks the group to join his resistance against Strahd
		- gives the party a few things
			- Sun Sword (mamma has and attuned to it)
			- GPS Feather once per day can call for help
			- Housing a few blocks over
	- Urwin asks the group to help get the seed back from the Druids at Yester Hill
		- This is the evil druids that worship Strahd
	- Urwin says he can help get an audiance with the Baron for the party
###############

Encounter in the Salvich Woods as they head to Yester Hill
	- See a faint Purple/Blue glowing light
		- Kind of hops from one tree to another
		- Creature has 150hp and 15AC
			- Uses the "Lure" ability if anything tries to follow
				- DC 14 wisdom save
			- Vine whip: 3 attacks +4 to hit 1d4 per
			- Consume: +5 to hit 1d8 and restrained if fail DC 15

Vallakovich family
	- Baron Vargas Vallokovich
	- Barroness Lydia Petrov
	- Two Bull mastifs 
		- Ursa and Major
	- Baronet (the son) Victor Valakovich
		- Detests family and trying to escape by building a teleportation circle

On they way to Yester Hill they can see an old delapedated structure
	- I want to tie this to Madam Eva somehow
		- Figure out how this is her "home"
	- Large hole in the roof
	- Looks like maybe a high bell tower or spire that is starting to fall over
	- No sign and overgrown pathway heading to it
		- Very far off in the distance

As they travel the Salvich Woods closer to Yester Hill
	- Loud booming and rumbling
		- Giant sentient trees (not good and will attack the players if spotted)

At Yester Hill
	- When they get there they can see the edge of the fog
		- Large and looming on the far side of the area
	- Many concentric parths leading to a cobbled together statue of Strahd
		- Made of twigs and sticks and a dull green glow in the center of it
	- Behind the statue looms a very very large tree

	****
	- As they a approach they can hear chanting
		- A ritual is being conducted to create a Treant (one of the giant tree creatures)
		- Strahd is present and will defend the Druids if they are attacked
			- 10 Druids and Strahd
			- They are all unaware of the party if the party approaches carefully
				- Preoccupied with the ritual at hand
	- Strahd often visits this place because of the image in the fog wall
		- His homeland Stenia (languague is Stenisian)

#### Special notes along the way
Fredro (The grave keeper)
	Burry the bones in yester hill

Rupert - husband (Bolot)
	Neck beard salt and pepper (need to name)
		Silver circular glasses with small crack
	Bread Crumb (name of place to do shady business)

They think they are digging up boddies to sell the gems

They got the note book from the grave keeper

--------------------------------------
# Session 8 (2022-05-23)

The third unknown figure is going to be someone in cahoots with Strahd (The Druid). I think there should be an encounter in the catacombs of the church. The bones have to remain on the ceremonial burial spot for the enchantment to work.

If they get the bones back then when Strahd turns up he is unable to gain entrance to the church. His goal was to burn down the church and the holy lands to remove the last bit of resistance to his dominion.

If they capture them I would suggest bringing it to the Baron as he serves as the final say on law and judgement in Vallaki.

##### My notes for the evening
They are going to try and join his side

Convinced Rupert to let them help	
	- Rupert doesn't want to die
	- He feels trapped
	- His family doesn't live in Vallaki

Helpful info for me
	- Baron Vargas Vallokovich
	- Barroness Lydia Petrov
	- Two Bull mastifs 
		- Ursa and Major

Browley - Leader
	- get us in get us out

--------------------------------------
# Session 9 (2022-06-13)

We were in person and there was mostly combat

2 of the 4 runes were ruined

Found parchment in sealed box written in Stenisian
	- Broken runes don't lose full power
		- Reduced effectiveness
	- Should runes fall and seeds be removed the curse should spread
		- Uncertain but could possibly purge the heart with a seed

Baron will send messenger in the morning
	- Asks the group to come speak to him
	- He is willing to admit they were correct
		- Asks what he can do to help
		- Knowing the fall of the runes he is a bit fearful

--------------------------------------
# Session 10 (2022-06-20)
